## 📋 What is code-review-agent?

code-review-agent is a simple tool that helps you check and fix code files automatically. It looks at your code in one markdown (.md) file. It checks 14 different areas that affect code quality and security. It uses 4 levels to rate problems from small to serious. The tool can also fix some issues on its own. It includes security checks based on OWASP guidelines to keep your code safe.

Best of all, it does not rely on any extra software or packages on your computer. You just run it as-is.

This tool is designed for developers but anyone can use it to review code easily.

## 🚀 Getting Started

code-review-agent is easy to start using. Follow these steps to download, install, and run it on your computer.

### 1. Download the tool

Click the big blue download button at the top or visit the official page here:

[Download code-review-agent](https://github.com/MohamedArafa97/code-review-agent/releases)

The link will take you to the release page where you can find the latest version.

### 2. Choose your file

Look for the latest release and select the download file that matches your computer system. The file might be named something like:

- `code-review-agent-windows.exe` for Windows  
- `code-review-agent-macos` for macOS  
- `code-review-agent-linux` for Linux  

Download this file to a folder you can easily find, like your Desktop or Downloads folder.

### 3. Run the tool

- On Windows: Double-click the `.exe` file to open it.  
- On macOS or Linux: You may need to give the file permission to run before opening it. Do this by right-clicking the file, choosing Properties, and allowing the file to run. Or use the terminal command `chmod +x filename` and then run `./filename`.  

You can also run the tool using the command line terminal by typing its path and filename.

### 4. Use the tool to review your code file

The program asks you to select the `.md` file that contains the code you want to check. This file should have the code you want to review, even if it's just one programming file saved inside markdown.

The tool then checks for issues in 14 areas, rates their severity, and lists the results.

### 5. Review Results and Fix Issues

The tool shows you a summary of issues found. For problems it can fix, it offers an option to fix automatically.

Follow the instructions on screen to apply fixes or review problems manually.

## 🔍 How It Works

code-review-agent scans your code in the markdown file by looking into 14 categories such as:

- Code style and formatting  
- Security issues, based on OWASP guidelines  
- Potential bugs and incorrect logic  
- Use of best coding practices  
- Performance suggestions  

It organizes issues by severity:

- Level 1: Informational tips  
- Level 2: Minor issues to consider  
- Level 3: Serious warnings that should be fixed  
- Level 4: Critical problems needing immediate action  

The tool runs static analysis, which means it looks at the code without running it. It can also fix some issues automatically which saves you time.

## 🛠️ Supported Languages & Tools

The agent mainly supports popular languages and frameworks, including:

- TypeScript  
- React  
- JavaScript  
- Common web technologies  

Even though the tool reads a markdown file, it extracts and analyzes these languages within it.

## 🚧 Troubleshooting

If the tool does not start or works incorrectly:

- Make sure you downloaded the right file for your computer’s system  
- Ensure you have permission to run files from unknown publishers (check your security settings)  
- Close other programs that might interfere, like antivirus temporarily  
- Restart your computer and try running the tool again  
- Check the README on the download page for any updates  

If issues continue, you can seek help by opening an issue on the GitHub repo.
